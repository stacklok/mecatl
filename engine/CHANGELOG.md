# Changelog — `github.com/stacklok/mecatl/engine`

All notable changes to the engine module's public API are recorded here. The
format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); changes
are classified per [COMPATIBILITY.md](./COMPATIBILITY.md) (Added = minor;
Changed/Deprecated/Removed = breaking, pre-v1 a minor bump).

The covered surface is the seven core packages (`session`, `governance`, `tool`,
`prompt`, `port`, `team`, `agent`); their committed API snapshots live in
[`engine/api/`](./api/).

## [Unreleased]

This is the **initial baseline**. The entries below record the establishment of
the module and its compatibility contract, not a change to a previously-published
surface.

### Added

- The engine became its own Go module, `github.com/stacklok/mecatl/engine`,
  importable independently of the host repo (monorepo via `go.work`). (#113,
  [ADR 0036](../docs/adr/0036-engine-module.md))
- A public API stability contract for the seven core packages: this CHANGELOG,
  [COMPATIBILITY.md](./COMPATIBILITY.md), the committed text snapshots under
  [`engine/api/`](./api/), and the `api-compat` freshness gate that fails CI on
  an unflagged change to the exported surface. (#114,
  [ADR 0037](../docs/adr/0037-engine-stability-contract.md))
- `engine/adapter/eventsource` reference fold (event-sourced `SessionStore.Load`
  rehydration): `Fold` reconstructs a `*session.Session` from a `port.EventLog`
  stream plus out-of-band creation metadata (`SessionMeta`), for hosts whose system
  of record is an append-only event log. It is an EXCLUDED reference adapter (no
  guarded-surface change) and ships with the documented reconstruction contract in
  [COMPATIBILITY.md](./COMPATIBILITY.md) (the only residual limitation is the
  provider-private `Reasoning`/`ProviderPhase`/`ItemID` replay fields). (#115,
  [ADR 0038](../docs/adr/0038-event-sourced-rehydration.md))
- `session`: `EvUserPrompt` event (+ `UserPromptPayload` + `Event.UserPrompt`). The
  durable event log now records the user-role messages the loop adds — the genuine
  client prompt and the harness-authored synthetic continuations (nudges/notices) —
  so an event-sourced fold reconstructs user-role turns (closing the "the log can't
  show what the user asked" gap, ADR 0027 row 11). It is LOG-ONLY: the relay appends
  it and skips it on the live client wire (the EvApproval/EvCompactionArchive
  precedent; wire `type` string passthrough, no proto enum). (#115,
  [ADR 0038](../docs/adr/0038-event-sourced-rehydration.md))

### Hygiene

- CI now runs `govulncheck` on the engine module (a reachable-vulnerability scan
  of its own dependency closure, separate from the root module's), and
  `.github/dependabot.yml` keeps the engine `go.mod` current — supply-chain
  hygiene for the engine library's consumers. No public-API change. (#118)
