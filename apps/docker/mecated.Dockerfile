# Local dev/demo image for mecated, built for `docker compose up` in the Studio
# workspace (apps/docker-compose.yml) only. NOT the project's official release
# artifact — that's built via `ko` from ../../.ko.yaml (see docs/adr/ for the
# release pipeline). This Dockerfile exists purely so Studio is runnable end to
# end against a real daemon without a separately-installed Go toolchain. It is a
# Studio-owned copy of the Slack bot example's
# sdk/typescript/examples/slack-bot/docker/mecated.Dockerfile, so the two demos
# can drift independently.
#
# Build context is the repository root (see docker-compose.yml: `context: ..`)
# since mecated needs the whole Go workspace (go.work references ./engine and the
# other in-repo modules).
